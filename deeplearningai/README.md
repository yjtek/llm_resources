#### Notes on using the OpenAI API outside of this classroom

To install the OpenAI Python library:
```
!pip install openai
```

The library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). 

You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:
 ```
 !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'
 ```

Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:

```
import openai
openai.api_key = "sk-..."
```

#### A note about the backslash
- In the course, we are using a backslash `\` to make the text fit on the screen without inserting newline '\n' characters.
- GPT-3 isn't really affected whether you insert newline characters or not.  But when working with LLMs in general, you may consider whether newline characters in your prompt may affect the model's performance.
